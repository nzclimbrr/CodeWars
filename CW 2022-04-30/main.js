// Description:
// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

// The greet function creatively returns "hello world!"
function greet() {
  const a = "hello"
  const b = "world!"
// Returning the variables together to form the full phrase using a template literal 
  return `${a} ${b}`
}
